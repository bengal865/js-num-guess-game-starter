## Overview

Build a JavaScript number guess game that:

 - generates a random number between 1 and 100
 - gives the user 10 tries to guess the mystery number
 - tells users if their guess was too high or too low
 - keeps track of users' previous guesses
 - changes the background color of the user's guess to red if the guess was incorrect
 - changes the background color of the user's guess to green if the guess was correct
 - tells the user the game is over if the user doesn't guess the mystery number in 10 (or fewer) tries
 - uses a function to check the user's guess
 - uses a function to add a RESET button to the page
 - uses a function to reset the game so the user can play again

## Your GitHub Repo

 - Duplicate the starter repo and name your copy of the repo: **num-guess-game-js**

## Sample Output

Your finished game will look similar to these examples:
