## Directions

 - Add your name, the date, and the project name to all your project files.
 - Use short, descriptive names for all four functions you'll write for this project.
 - TIP: Use lowercase if your function name is made up of a single word; use camelcase if your function name is made up of two or more words.
 - [main.js] Write a function that prompts the user for his/her LAST NAME; return the last name to another variable.
 - [main.js] Write another function that prompts the user for his/her height in inches; return the user's height in inches to another variable; make sure to return this value as a **NUMBER** so JS can use it to do math later in your script.
 - [main.js] Write a third function that converts the user's height in inches to centimeters; return the user's height in centimeters to another variable.
 - [main.js] Write a fourth function that greets the user by name and tells the user their height in centimeters; display this output in the browser console; use the **toFixed( )** method to display the user's height in centimeters to 2 decimal places.
