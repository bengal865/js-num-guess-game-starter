## Overview

Build a JavaScript number guess game that:

 - generates a random number between 1 and 100
 - gives the user 10 tries to guess the mystery number
 - tells users if their guess was too high or too low
 - keeps track of users' previous guesses
 - changes the background color of the user's guess to red if the guess was incorrect
 - changes the background color of the user's guess to green if the guess was correct
 - tells the user the game is over if the user doesn't guess the mystery number in 10 (or fewer) tries
 - uses a function to check the user's guess
 - uses a function to add a RESET button to the page
 - uses a function to reset the game so the user can play again

## Your GitHub Repo

 - Duplicate the starter repo and name your copy of the repo: **num-guess-game-js**
 - Submit the URL for your repo on Google Classroom

## Sample Output

Your finished game will look similar to these examples:

![Guessed the mystery number](mdn-num-guess-final.png "Winning the game")
![Option to play again](mdn-num-guess-new-game.png "Starting a new game")

## Directions

 - Add your name, the date, and the project name to all your project files.
 - Use short, descriptive names for all four functions you'll write for this project.
 - TIP: Use lowercase if your function name is made up of a single word; use camelcase if your function name is made up of two or more words.
 - [main.js] Write a function that prompts the user for his/her LAST NAME; return the last name to another variable.
 - [main.js] Write another function that prompts the user for his/her height in inches; return the user's height in inches to another variable; make sure to return this value as a **NUMBER** so JS can use it to do math later in your script.
 - [main.js] Write a third function that converts the user's height in inches to centimeters; return the user's height in centimeters to another variable.
 - [main.js] Write a fourth function that greets the user by name and tells the user their height in centimeters; display this output in the browser console; use the **toFixed( )** method to display the user's height in centimeters to 2 decimal places.
